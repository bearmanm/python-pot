#Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.
#Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
#Small pizza (S): $15
#Medium pizza (M): $20
#Large pizza (L): $25
#Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2
#Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3
#Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1
