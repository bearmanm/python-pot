#You could use this code in the real world in a variety of ways, such as:

#To create a simple chatbot that greets users by name.
#To write a script that automatically greets users when they log in to a system.
#To create a personalized greeting for users of a website or app.
#To add a personal touch to your code, such as by greeting users by name in your documentation or test code.

#Here is an example of how you could use the code to create a simple chatbot that greets users by name:
def greeting(name):
    print('Hello', name)

# Start a loop to continuously greet users.
while True:
    # Get the user's name.
    user_name = input('Enter your name:\n')

    # Greet the user by name.
    greeting(user_name)

    # Ask the user if they want to continue.
    continue_greeting = input('Do you want to continue? (y/n):\n')

    # If the user does not want to continue, break out of the loop.
    if continue_greeting != 'y':
        break

# Print a goodbye message.
print('Goodbye!')
